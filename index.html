                <p>
                    Recognizing Gombe State's agro-based economy, Governor Dankwambo prioritized the procurement and distribution of millions of bags of fertilizers to local farmers at subsidized rates. The administration purchased and rehabilitated dozens of tractors, resulting in over three hundred tractors for Gombe farmers. Markets were constructed to provide farmers with comfortable places to sell their products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ministry of Animal Husbandry & Nomadic Affairs, created to support herders and farmers, established veterinary clinics in Boh, Talasse, Deba, Malamsidi, Kumo, Nafada, and Kaltungo, providing vaccinations for livestock. Additionally, the administration mapped and designated 'Grazing Routes' for herders.

                <h2>Water Supply Achievements</h2>
                <p>
                    Under Governor Dankwambo's administration from 2011 to 2019, significant strides were made in water supply in Gombe State. Initially, water supply was limited to a few areas, but Dankwambo expanded it significantly. Key projects included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investing over 8 billion naira in maintaining and operating the Gombe Regional Water Supply Scheme.</li>
                    <li>Awarding a 4.2 billion naira contract to rehabilitate and extend water pipelines, covering new areas in Gombe metropolis and 11 additional villages.</li>
                    <li>Rehabilitating traditional water systems and enhancing facilities in Malam Inna, Wuro Juli, and Tula village.</li>
                    <li>Establishing fish farms, a Fish Fingering Hatchery centre, and conducting feasibility studies for water supply from Balanga Dam to several towns.</li>
                    <li>Proposing the Gombe South Regional Water Scheme to draw water from Balanga Dam, aiming to cover multiple local government areas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Challenges included a lack of water meters, low public awareness of water value, and the need for treatment plant expansion. Recommendations for future improvements include activating hydro-electricity from Dadin Kowa Dam and fostering patriotism and continuity in government projects.
